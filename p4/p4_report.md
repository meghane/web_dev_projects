# Project 4 - JavaScript and jQuery
### Goal
* Design a fully functional, visually pleasant, “Tic-Tac-Toe game”.
### Topic
* Modify and expand / improve the provided jQuery template in meaningful ways, for example:
    * Adding HTML
    * Adding CSS, i.e. embedding the board in a Bootstrap-compatible template
    * Making the (end-of-game) messages more friendly
  
## Report
* For this project, I used Brackets as my editor. I used the Google Chrome browser to test my page, and when uploading to the server, I used the Edge browser. I validated the HTML5 code for correctness and compliance with the standard using the website https://validator.w3.org/. The BootStrap template I used is located here: https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css. The jQuery template used for the project is located here: https://jsfiddle.net/rtoal/ThPEH/. 
* Some improvements I made to the website were adding a score and tie tracker. When either player (X or O) wins the game, their score increases by 1. When a game ends in a tie, the tie counter increases by 1. Another improvement I made was once a game is over, the text of which player won or if it was a tie also appears below the game grid. I also added a button for the players to be able to restart the game after each round; however, the players will not lose the overall scores unless the page is refreshed.
