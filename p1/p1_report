# Project 1 - Home Page
### Goal
* Basic home page using HTML5 and minimal CSS (no Bootstrap yet). 
### Topic
* A personal web page that could serve as your online resume.

## Report
For this project, I used Brackets as my editor. I used the Google Chrome browser to test my page, and when uploading to the server, I used the Edge browser. I validated the HTML5 code for correctness and compliance with the standard using the website, https://validator.w3.org/.
