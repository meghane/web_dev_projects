# Project 5 - Portal
### Goal
* Design a visually pleasant portal with links to all your projects and homework assignments during
this course, using HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap.
### Topic
* It should contain links to all your work in this class, organized in a meaningful way.

## Report
* For this project, I used Brackets as my editor. I used the Google Chrome browser to test my page, and when uploading to the server, I used the Edge browser. I validated the HTML5 code for correctness and compliance with the standard using the website https://validator.w3.org/. The BootStrap template I used is located here: https://startbootstrap.com/template/the-big-picture. The free-use image I used for the background is found here: https://unsplash.com/photos/pine-fores-with-mountain-background-tKyXbJNH2bQ.
